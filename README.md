Code

Code to extract data. Will improve and annotate along the way (improve
where needed!) to extract metadata and PDFs of arXiv and biorXiv papers
with selected substrings related to Covid-19. Titles speak for itself
for now.

Data
----

Metadata (e.g., abstracts, titles, authors, etc.) for Covid-19 related
repository publications from biorXiv and arXiv.
